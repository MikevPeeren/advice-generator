## My process

I have developed using a Desktop First approach. I worked from top to bottom and added the background as first. My last steps was making minor tweaks here and there for responsiveness. Finally I added the API call to get a random Advice.

### Built with

- Desktop-first workflow
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - Stylesheet language
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework

### What I learned

I have learned more about Mobile First design approach. I have also learned more about positioning in CSS in order for components to render properly.
